# Summary

I made this low-poly twist vase specifically to hold http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:84075 and it looks great in really shiny/transparent materials.

**TIP:** The default size is quite small. If you want one that's just under 200mm high scale it to 165%.

**UPDATE**: I tried printing a version of the vase that was scaled up 165%.  Looks great even when it's big!  https://youtu.be/QR50FKFm7UU

Note: I requested and received permission from jonasrh to use his photo (http://www.thingiverse.com/make:317855) of my vase as the cover for this thing.  Very professional picture =)

**NOTE:** If you like this vase perhaps you'll like the *magnetic* version that you can stick on stuff:  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2551824
