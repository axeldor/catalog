# Summary

This is my remix  Esquilo's Arduino case.
I think the intention behind the original design was to create a smart looking case to house a finished project.
My remix isn't as pretty as it is intended to be a permanent home for my prototyping Arduino with the greater emphasis on ease of use. The main difference being that holes in the lid are bigger allowing a view of the pin label, printed on the circuit board.


Other Modification:
1) Some supports on the lid hole the Arduino secure without the need for screws.

2) Most of the lid has been made thinner so it can act as window... sort of :), if made of transparent material.

3) Added two more clips at front and back to hold lid secure.

4) Hole to reset button is larger fore easy access.



# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Ultimaker
Printer: Ultimaker 2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.4 nozzle __ 0.2 mm layer thickness
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
top & bottom shell thickness was set to 0.8mm.  if u set it lower u might get infill rather than a solid window on the lid.
